============================================================
    MALICIOUS SNIFFER (Man-in-the-Middle) ACTIVATED        
============================================================
Attack Type: Man-in-the-Middle on DH + RSA Key Exchange
Position: Between Sender (mta_Client_SS) and Receiver (mta_Server_RS)
Simulation Start Time: 0
============================================================


[MITM ATTACK - DH_HELLO FROM SENDER]
Time: 0.0135312 seconds
Sender's real DH public key: 63730
Sender's RSA: e=17 n=3233
Sniffer's shared secret with Sender: 9
Session key with Sender: k:9
Sniffer substitutes DH public key: 63730 -> 20
Sniffer substitutes RSA keys: e=17 n=3233 -> e=17 n=3233

[MITM ATTACK - DH_HANDSHAKE FROM RECEIVER]
Time: 0.0143952 seconds
Receiver's real DH public key: 65147
Receiver's RSA: e=17 n=3233
Sniffer's shared secret with Receiver: 5
Session key with Receiver: k:5
Sniffer substitutes DH public key: 65147 -> 2
Sniffer substitutes RSA keys: e=17 n=3233 -> e=17 n=3233

============================================================
MITM ATTACK SUCCESSFUL!
Two separate sessions established:
  Sender <-> Sniffer: shared=9 key=k:9
  Sniffer <-> Receiver: shared=5 key=k:5
